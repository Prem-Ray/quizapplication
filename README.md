## 🚀 Features

### 📖 Quiz Functionality
- Multiple-choice questions (MCQs).
- Automatic score calculation.
- Timer showing total time spent.
- Result page with score and time taken.

### 🛡️ Anti-Cheating Mechanisms
- **Tab switch detection** → Warns if the user switches/minimizes the tab.
- **Blocked shortcuts**:
  - Developer Tools (`F12`, `Ctrl+Shift+I`, `⌘+Option+I`, etc.).
  - Page Reload (`Ctrl+R`, `⌘+R`, `F5`).
  - Tab/Window close (`Ctrl+W`, `⌘+W`, `Alt+F4`, `⌘+Q`).
  - Copy/Paste/Right-click actions.
- **Max warnings**: User is allowed `3` warnings. On the 3rd violation, the exam is closed automatically.
- Works on both **Windows** and **Mac** devices (uses `ctrlKey` and `metaKey` detection).
